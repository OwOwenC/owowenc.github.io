    <h1>📄 Hydry Channel gate</h1>
    <br>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project focuses on solving real-world challenges in water resource management, specifically in flow regulation and remote monitoring. The designed system integrates gate control, electric actuation, flow monitoring, wireless data transmission, and solar power supply to adapt to outdoor and remote environments. The technical solutions have been officially recognized and granted two national utility model patents by the China National Intellectual Property Administration.
      </p>

    <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
      <ul class="custom-indent">
        <li>Improve automation of hydraulic facilities to reduce manual operations</li>
        <li>Enable precise remote control and real-time water flow monitoring</li>
        <li>Support off-grid operation with solar power supply</li>
        <li>Optimize structural sealing and durability</li>
        <li>Prepare the technology for commercialization and industrial application</li>
      </ul>


    <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
      <ul class="custom-indent">
        <li><strong>SolidWorks</strong>: Used for mechanical structure modeling, 3D part design, and assembly drawings</li>
      </ul>
      

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Mastering CAD Tools</strong> – Lack of experience with SolidWorks led to initial difficulties in modeling and required extensive learning and revisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Patent Text Composition</strong> – Writing in legally and technically accurate language required adherence to strict formatting and expression standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Avoiding Similar Technology</strong> – Conducted prior-art analysis to ensure novelty and avoid infringement or overlap with existing technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Patent Application Process</strong> – Navigated the full cycle of drafting, diagram creation, and electronic submission, gaining an in-depth understanding of the intellectual property application procedure.

    <h2>Growth</h2>
      <p>
        This project was not a standalone endeavor but rather a <strong>progressive journey through two stages of development</strong>, each representing a deeper level of technical understanding and practical refinement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first stage, I designed the Combined Hydry Channel gate (CN211171843U), which focused on simplifying structure and installation by replacing traditional hydraulic concrete works with prefabricated components. Through this project, I learned how to:
      </p>
      <ul class="custom-indent">
        <li>Break down hydraulic systems into modular mechanical components.</li>
        <li>Optimize gate movement using screw mechanisms and sliding rails.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Building on this foundation, I proceeded to develop the Automated Hydry Channel gate (CN214695471U), where I integrated real-time monitoring, wireless communication, and solar power systems. This more advanced system pushed me to:
      </p>
      <ul class="custom-indent">
        <li>Study electrical and energy integration, including solar charging circuits.</li>
        <li>Understand how mechanical design, electronics, and software must harmonize</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Through both phases, I grew from a structural designer into a more holistic engineer capable of handling multidisciplinary system design. I also became familiar with the full lifecycle of a patent, from idea incubation to successful authorization. This experience gave me the confidence to pursue more complex engineering problems with a clear vision and a stronger problem-solving mindset.
      </p>


    <h2>What I learn</h2>
      <ul class="custom-indent">
        <li>Gained proficiency in SolidWorks part and assembly design.</li>
        <li>Acquired knowledge of utility patent drafting and formatting.</li>
        <li>Learned how to evaluate and differentiate technical solutions for legal protection.</li>
        <li>Gained insight into the structure and operation logic of automated hydraulic systems.</li>
      </ul>
    

    <h2>Certification</h2>
      <p>
        This project has resulted in two authorized national utility model patents:
